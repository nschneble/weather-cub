# 🐻 Weather Cub
A bear-y good macOS menu bar weather applet.

## The Inspo

It's the spiritual offspring of the [Weather Bear](https://github.com/nschneble/weather-bear) app concept I built in an evening for an (unsuccessful) Apple contractor interview.

The settings will all be menu items, similar to [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/).

## The Deets

It’s an OpenAI-powered little weather applet. It’ll ask for location services, then use an API integration to get the current weather. Just a couple of basic settings. Fahrenheit or Celsius. Whether to include the “feels like”. Maybe a refresh interval.

* It’s a macOS app that lives in the menu bar (no other UI)
* shows an icon for the current weather conditions
* has minimal text for the current temperature

## Why Use OpenAI? Isn't That Overkill?

Sure is!

## Installation

It'll be a Homebrew cask. You know, when it's ready.
